Git Hamster
===========

**Does not support concurrent updates to Project Hamster currently**

Automatically logs Git commits and times elapsed from the specified directory into a 'times.csv' file. Can also log custom tasks and start of day. For now the documentation is only in gitTimeTracker.js.

Install
=======
Currently, two steps:
1. npm install
2. sudo apt-get install hamster-applet
